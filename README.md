## Fee Categories Implementation

The system now supports multiple fee categories in the fee collection module. Here's how it works:

### Database Structure
- The `Fee` model has two fields for fee categories:
  - `feeCategory`: A string field for backward compatibility (stores comma-separated categories)
  - `feeCategories`: A text field that can store multiple categories

### Backend Implementation
- The server handles both single and multiple fee categories
- For GET routes: The server converts the `feeCategory` string into an array of categories
- For POST/PUT routes: The server accepts either `feeCategory` as a string or `feeCategories` as an array

### Frontend Implementation
- The UI displays checkboxes for selecting multiple fee categories
- Form submissions include both `feeCategory` (string) and `feeCategories` (array) for backward compatibility
- Records display all selected categories as tags for better visibility

### Usage
1. When creating a new fee record, select one or more fee categories
2. The system will calculate the total based on the categories selected
3. When updating a record, you can modify the categories as needed

### Error Handling
- The system validates fee category data on both client and server side
- If a category format is invalid, appropriate error messages are displayed
- The system ensures backward compatibility with existing records
